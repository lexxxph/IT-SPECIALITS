<h1><u>NETWORK ATTACKS</u></h1>

<p>A network attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to an organization's network, with the objective of stealing data or perform other malicious activity. </p>

<h2>TYPES OF TCP/IP ATTACKS</h2>
<p> <img src="https://ipcisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cyber-attacks-network-attacks-ipcisco.com_-835x500.png" width="500">
<p>- Distributed DoS is an amplified DoS attack using many infected hosts called zombies to overwhelm a target.<br>
 - DNS Poisoning is an attack where the attacker has successfully infected a host to accept false DNS records pointing to malicious servers.<br>
 - Man-in-the-Middle is an attack where an attacker intercepts communication between two hosts.<br>
 - Replay is a type of spoofing attack where the attacker captures an authenticated packet, alters it, and sends it to the original destination. <br>
 - Spoofing is an attack where the attacker forges an IP address to gain access to resources. <br>
 - Syn Flood is a type of DoS attack that exploits the TCP three-way handshake..<br>

<h3>PROTECTING AGAINST NETWORK ATTACKS</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://www.techsparks.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/radius-network-security.jpg"width="500"></p>
    <p style="color:white;text-align:left;"> 1. There is no single solution to protect against all TCP/IP. <br>
	2. One solution is to use a defense-in-depth approach, also known as a layered approach, to security. <br>
	3. This requires a combination of networking devices and services working together in tandem. <br>
	4. All network devices including the router and switches must be secured to prevent attackers from tampering with the devices.<br>
