<h1 style="font-family:sans-serif"> What is a Malware? </h1>
<p style="background-color:beige;"> <h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> Malwares are basically a term for malicious software such as viruses, trojans, and ransomwares. It is usually made up of codes made by the attacker with an objective of bypassing security to gain unauthorized access to a system or a network as well as cause damage to the system's hardware and software alike. It is typically used by cyber attackers to victimize people for data or financial gain. </h3>

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif"> Types of Malwares </h2>
	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 1. Viruses </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif">  Virus is a malicious software that is intended for spreading of damage to a device and usually can be found from untrusted websites and emails. It is designed to steal or damage data through self replication and spreading it to the system. Computer viruses modify other legitimate host files (or references to them) so that when the victim's files are executed, the virus will also be executed. Moreover, viruses are the only type of malware that "infects" other files. This makes cleanup especially difficult because the malware needs to be run by legitimate programs.   </p>

		
	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 2. Trojans </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Trojans are malicious program that disguises itself as a legitimate file which misleads its user and disrupt the system or damage data. A Trojan must be executed by its victim to do its work. Trojans usually arrive via email or are pushed on users when they visit infected websites. The most popular Trojan type is the fake antivirus program, which pops up and claims you`re infected, then instructs you to run a program to clean your PC. Users swallow the bait and the Trojan takes root.Trojans are hard to defend against for two reasons: They're easy to write and spread by tricking end-users â€” which a patch, firewall, and other traditional defense cannot stop. </p>
		
	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 3. Ransomware </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Ransomware is a malware that forcibly denies access to the system and its file with an intention of gaining money by demanding payment from the victim. Most ransomware is a Trojan, so it is usually spread through social engineering. Ransomware can be prevented just like every other type of malware program, but once executed, it can be hard to reverse the damage without a good, validated backup.  </p>
		

	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 4. Adware and scams </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif">  Adwares are malwares that is designed to involuntarily open advertisements that are irrelevant to you while using an application. It attempts to expose infected end users to unwanted and potentially malicious advertisements. Common adware can redirect users' browser search queries to similar web pages that contain advertisements for other products. </p>
		

	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 5. Spyware </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Spwares are malwares that records the user's activity with an objective of gaining data and collecting of confidential information which creates security vulnerabilities for the victim such as identity theft or credit card fraud. Adware and spyware  are usually the easiest to remove. Because its intentions are not as evil as other types of malware. However, The presence of an adware/spyware program should serve as a warning that the device or user has some sort of weakness that needs to be corrected, before real badness comes calling.</p>
		
	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 6. Spam or Phishing  </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Phishing ang spams are usually occur in emails, messages, and website link which disguise itself like they are from trusted sources with an intention of acquiring personal and financial data from the victim. </p>

	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 7. Worms  </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif">Worms are malware that spreads to the system and network that can disrupt a computer's function as well as damage and steal data. A characteristic of  computer worms is that they replicate themselves. Take the infamous Iloveyou worm as an example. When down, the worm infected almost all e-mail users around the world, overloaded phone systems (with scams), blocked TV networks, and even delayed  daily newspapers for half a day.</h3>

	<h4 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 8. Bots  </h4>
	<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Bots are malware that infect a computer to gain access to it remotely and it is used to launch attack such as DDos, keylogging, and spreading other types of malware.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif"> How to know if your computer is infected with malware?  </h2>

<ul style="font-family:sans-serif">
  <li>Your device begins running slower than usual - If your device suddenly slow down without problem, there might be a malware infection. Malwares are known to consume computer's resources which hinders other programs from functioning properly. </li>
  <li>You notice a shortage of available storage space -  Malwares download numerous unwanted files that can potentially damage your device.</li>
  <li>Pop-ups and unwanted programs appear on your device -  If pop-up ads appear to your computer without warning and you find unwanted programs in your devices then, most likely, there is malware infection.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif"> How does malware spread?  </h2>
<ul style="font-family:sans-serif">
<li> User interactions </li>
  <li>Emailed links and executable files</li>
  <li>Message through social media </li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-family:sans-serif"> How do you protect yourself from malwares?  </h2>
<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 1. Install anti-virus software </h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Anti-virus software safeguards your device against dangerous software that could compromise the system. It will run a scan on your computer to detect and remove malware, as well as give automatic updates to improve protection against newly generated infections. </p>

<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 2. Update software regularly </h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> To prevent attackers from obtaining access to your computer through weaknesses in older and outdated systems, it's critical to keep your software up to date. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 3. Buy apps and things through trusted sources</h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Purchasing software from reputable sources minimizes the risk of malware infection on your device. Big companies will take great effort to avoid tarnishing their name by disseminating malware. You may verify a source's validity by looking at the entire name, list of published apps, and contact information in the app description on Google Play or Apple. </p>


<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 4. Don't click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources</h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> Phishing is still the most common method for hackers to infect your device with malware. Phishing schemes entice victims to open emails or click on links that look to come from a credible company or respectable source. The link may take you to a bogus website that asks for your personal information or to a website that directly infects your computer with malware. If you're unsure about something, don't click the link. </p>

<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 5. Install and enable firewall</h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> A firewall protects a private computer network from malicious attacks by prohibiting all unauthorized access to or from it. A firewall, in addition to anti-virus software, acts as an extra line of defense against malware, lowering the risk of an attack. </p>

<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif"> 6. Back up data regularly</h3>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> It's critical to back up your data and files on a regular basis to ensure that you can still recover all of your crucial files and data if your computer becomes infected with malware. This will assist in minimizing any harm and ensuring that you are not a victim of ransomware.</p>
